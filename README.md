# osdev

THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

osdev is a pluggable bash script that automates a number of my OpenStack development
tasks. While the current plugins focus on automating a number of [OpenStack gerrit workflows](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html),
the simple plugin approach can integrate with any scripting.

## Install

Clone the repo in the directory of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/bodenr/osdev.git
```

Set the following ENV vars (in your `.bashrc` or equivalent).
```
OSDEV_HOME=/path/to/cloned/osdev
PATH=${PATH}:${OSDEV_HOME}
```

If you have an IDE you wish to launch git repo dirs with (e.g. pycharm), also
set the following:
```
export OSDEV_PROJECT_LAUNCHER=/path/to/myexe
```

## Uninstall

* Remove the ENV vars you setup during installation.
* Delete the ``osdev`` git directory from installation.
* Delete the ``~/.osdev`` directory.

## Creating new plugins

Have a look at the [existing plugins](plugins/) for how to implement the actual plugin
source file(s).

To add your plugins, choose one of following:

* Add your plugin(s) under the ``plugins`` dir of ``osdev``.
* Update the env var ``OSDEV_PLUGIN_PATHS`` to include a path to your plugin file(s) or directories
contain your plugins.
